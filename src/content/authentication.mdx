## API keys

Generate project-scoped API keys from your dashboard and send them as an `Authorization: Bearer` header. Keys are permissioned via roles, so you can create read-only variants for SDK demos or public sandboxes.

```ts
const request = await fetch('https://docs.dox.dev/api/projects', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DOX_TOKEN}` },
})
```

## OAuth handshakes

Dox exposes a lightweight OAuth 2.1 server to support partner integrations. Enable the feature, register redirect URIs, and we handle PKCE along with refresh token rotation out of the box.

## Session hardening

- Device-bound tokens signed with P-256
- Built-in detection for leaked secrets using the provenance service
- Webhook notifications any time a secret is regenerated
