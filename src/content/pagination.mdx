description: How to author documentation pages using MDX in Dox.
---

Every documentation page in Dox is an `.mdx` file inside `src/content/`. Each file needs frontmatter at the top with a `title` and `description`:

```mdx
---
title: My Page Title
description: A short summary for SEO and navigation.
---

Your content starts here.
```

## Markdown features

Dox supports all standard Markdown syntax plus a few extras:

| Feature | Syntax |
| --- | --- |
| Headings | `## H2`, `### H3`, `#### H4` |
| Code blocks | Fenced with language identifier |
| Tables | Pipe-delimited columns |
| Lists | Ordered and unordered |
| Links | `[text](url)` |
| Images | `![alt](src)` |

## Built-in components

Dox includes several JSX components you can use directly in MDX:

### Notes

```mdx
<Note type="info" title="Heads up">
Informational callout with a blue accent.
</Note>
```

### Code groups

```mdx
<CodeGroup title="Install">

\`\`\`bash
npm install my-package
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
yarn add my-package
\`\`\`

</CodeGroup>
```

## File organization

Pages can be nested in subdirectories. A file at `src/content/guides/setup.mdx` is referenced in `docs.json` as `"guides/setup"`.

<Note type="info" title="Sample page">
This is example content that ships with the Dox template. Replace it with your own product documentation.
</Note>
