description: Extend Dox with custom components, layout tokens, and new pages.
---

Dox is designed to be extended. Every part of the UI is built with composable components and shared layout tokens.

## Layout tokens

Spacing, panel styles, and typography are centralized in `src/config/layout.ts`:

```ts
export const layout = {
  pagePadding: 'px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-12',
  panel: 'rounded-xl border border-border/40 bg-muted',
}
```

Update these values to restyle the entire shell without touching individual components.

## Adding custom components

Create new components in `src/components/` and use them directly in MDX files. Dox automatically makes common components like `Note` and `CodeGroup` available in all MDX content.

To register a new MDX component, add it to the components map in `src/data/get-doc.ts`.

## Section primitives

Use the built-in layout helpers from `src/components/layout/sections.tsx`:

- **`PageContainer`** — consistent page-level padding
- **`ContentStack`** — vertical spacing for content sections
- **`Panel`** / **`MutedPanel`** — styled card containers

These helpers consume the layout tokens, so changing a token updates every section that uses it.

This is example content that ships with the Dox template. Replace it with your own product documentation.
