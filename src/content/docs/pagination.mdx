# Pagination

## Cursor strategy

Every collection endpoint ships with cursor-based pagination so you can stream large datasets without skipping or duplicating records.

```ts
const response = await client.conversations.list({
  limit: 50,
  cursor: nextCursor, // provided in the previous response
})
```

## Parameters

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `limit` | number | Defaults to 25. Maximum of 200. |
| `cursor` | string | Opaque string returned as `nextCursor`. |
| `direction` | "forward" \| "backward" | Enables reverse traversal for audit tooling. |

## Error handling

Send the `Retry-After` header whenever a client attempts to fetch beyond the available window so they can recover gracefully.
