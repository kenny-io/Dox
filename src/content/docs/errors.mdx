# Errors

All responses include a stable error schema so clients can branch unambiguously.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "validation_error",
    "message": "The subject field is required.",
    "traceId": "req_8dkG1z"
  }
}
```

## Error types

- `validation_error`: input failed schema validation
- `auth_error`: API key or OAuth token is invalid
- `rate_limit`: client exceeded the allocated quota
- `internal_error`: something unexpected happened on our side

Provide the `traceId` when contacting support so we can pinpoint the request in seconds.
