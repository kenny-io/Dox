# Quickstart

## 1. Bootstrap the workspace

```bash
npx create-next-app dox-project --ts --eslint --tailwind
cd dox-project
npm install @dox/template
```

Import your API schema or seed MDX files inside `src/content/docs`. Each MDX file becomes a route that is automatically indexed by search and navigation.

<Note type="info" title="Preview tip">
Run `npm run dev` and open `/showcase` whenever you tweak typography so you can compare both themes side by side.
</Note>

## 2. Configure navigation

Update `src/data/docs.ts` with a `group`, `title`, and `description` for every page. The sidebar and mobile navigation derive their structure from that map, so there is nothing else to keep in sync.

<Note type="warning" title="Missing entry">
If you forget to register a page in `docsEntries`, `next dev` still compiles the MDX file but users will have no way to reach it. Keep navigation data as the source of truth.
</Note>

### Multi-language config example

<CodeGroup title="Bootstrap data source">

```ts
import { defineDocs } from '@dox/config'

export const docs = defineDocs({
  root: './src/content/docs',
  navigation: './src/data/docs.ts',
})
```

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Keep parity with the TypeScript config by mirroring slugs.")
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. Deploy

Dox runs anywhere Next.js does: Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, or your own container runtime. Because we avoid proprietary services, every environment variable and API secret lives entirely under your control.

<Note type="danger" title="Build fails on deploy?">
Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` and any MDX-related env vars are defined in the hosting dashboard. The server components assume those values exist during `next build`.
</Note>
