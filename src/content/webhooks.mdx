## Events

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `conversation.created` | Fired when the first message is stored. |
| `conversation.resolved` | Fired when status changes to `resolved`. |
| `attachment.failed` | Fired when virus scanning blocks a file. |

## Signing payloads

Each webhook payload includes a `dox-signature` header. Re-compute the signature using HMAC-SHA256 with your webhook secret.

```ts
import crypto from 'node:crypto'

function isValidSignature(payload: string, signature: string, secret: string) {
  const digest = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret).update(payload).digest('hex')
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(signature), Buffer.from(digest))
}
```

## Retries

Dox retries delivery for twelve hours using exponential backoff. Set the `x-dox-delivery-id` header as idempotency key to deduplicate downstream.
