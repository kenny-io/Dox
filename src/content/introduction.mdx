Dox is an open-source documentation template that gives you a production-ready docs site out of the box. It is built with the Next.js App Router, MDX for content authoring, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Every page you write is a `.mdx` file — no CMS, no vendor lock-in, and full control over your infrastructure.

## What's included

- **MDX content authoring** — write documentation in Markdown with JSX components
- **Tabbed navigation** — organize content into tabs, groups, and pages via a single `docs.json` file
- **API reference generation** — drop in an OpenAPI spec and get interactive endpoint docs with a built-in "Try It" console
- **Full-text search** — instant client-side search with relevance scoring
- **Dark mode** — automatic light/dark theming with customizable brand colors
- **Responsive layout** — sidebar navigation, table of contents, and mobile-friendly design
- **Code blocks** — syntax highlighting with Shiki, multi-language code groups, and copy-to-clipboard

## Getting started

The fastest way to create a new Dox project is with the CLI:

```bash
npx create-dox my-docs
```

The CLI prompts you for a project name, description, brand preset, and optional GitHub repo URL — then scaffolds a ready-to-run docs site with starter content, navigation, and dependencies installed.

Alternatively, clone the template manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kenny-io/Dox.git my-docs
cd my-docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How it works

Dox uses a file-based content model. All documentation lives in `src/content/` as `.mdx` files. Navigation structure is defined in `docs.json` at the project root — you list your tabs, groups, and pages there, and the sidebar, breadcrumbs, and routing are derived automatically.

For API documentation, point the API Reference tab in `docs.json` to an OpenAPI spec file. Dox parses the spec and generates endpoint pages with parameter tables, request/response schemas, code samples, and an interactive playground.

## When to use Dox

Dox is a good fit when you want to:

- **Ship docs fast** — start writing content in minutes, not days
- **Own your stack** — no third-party service dependencies or monthly fees
- **Customize freely** — extend the Next.js app with your own components, analytics, or auth
- **Document APIs** — auto-generate reference docs from an OpenAPI spec
