Dox ships with a flexible theming system that lets you match your docs to your brand. All colors are defined in `src/data/site.ts` and applied as CSS custom properties.

## Brand presets

Two presets are included out of the box:

| Preset | Accent | Style |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `primary` | Green (#10B981) | Clean and modern |
| `secondary` | Purple (#8B5CF6) | Bold and vibrant |

Set the active preset in `src/data/site.ts`:

```ts
export const siteConfig = {
  brandPreset: 'primary', // or 'secondary'
  // ...
}
```

## Custom colors

Override individual color tokens in the `brandPresets` object:

```ts
brandPresets: {
  primary: {
    light: {
      background: '#FFFFFF',
      foreground: '#0F172A',
      accent: '#10B981',
      // ...
    },
    dark: {
      background: '#0B1120',
      foreground: '#F8FAFC',
      accent: '#34D399',
      // ...
    },
  },
}
```

Most colors accept hex values which are auto-converted to HSL. The sidebar tokens (`sidebarActiveBg`, `sidebarActiveText`) use raw HSL strings for translucent effects.

## Dark mode

Dark mode is automatic. Dox reads the system preference and provides a toggle in the header. Both light and dark palettes are defined in your brand preset, so switching themes is seamless.
