      summary: Get a quote for a token transfer
      description: >-
        This endpoint can be used to request a quote for a transfer of one token to another, cross
        chain or not.

        The endpoint returns a `Step` object which contains information about the estimated result as
        well as a `transactionRequest` which can directly be sent to your wallet.

        The estimated result can be found inside the `estimate`, containing the estimated `toAmount`
        of the requested `Token` and the `toAmountMin`, which is the guaranteed minimum value that the
        transfer will yield including slippage.

        If you want to learn more about how to use this endpoint please have a look at our
        [guide](https://docs.li.fi/more-integration-options/li.fi-api/requesting-a-quote).

      summary: Get a quote for a token transfer
      description: >-
        This endpoint is an alternative to the `v1/quote` endpoint, taking a `toAmount` value rather
        than `fromAmount`. This endpoint will calculate an appropriate `fromAmount` based on the
        specified `toAmount`, and use this value to generate the quote data.

        This endpoint can be used to request a quote for a transfer of one token to another, cross
        chain or not.

        The endpoint returns a `Step` object which contains information about the estimated result as
        well as a `transactionRequest` which can directly be sent to your wallet.

        The estimated result can be found inside the `estimate`, containing the estimated required
        `fromAmount` of the sending `Token` to meet the `toAmountMin` of the receiving token, which is
        the guaranteed minimum value that the transfer will yield including slippage.

        If you want to learn more about how to use this endpoint please have a look at our
        [guide](https://docs.li.fi/more-integration-options/li.fi-api/requesting-a-quote).

      description: >-
        Cross chain transfers might take a while to complete. Waiting on the transaction on the
        sending chain doesn't help here. For this reason we build a simple endpoint that let's you
        check the status of your transfer.

        Important: The endpoint returns a `200` successful response even if the transaction can not be
        found. This behavior accounts for the case that the transaction hash is valid but the
        transaction has not been mined yet.

        While non of the parameters `fromChain`, `toChain` and `bridge` are required, passing the
        `fromChain` parameter will speed up the request and is therefore encouraged.

      description: >-
        Cross chain relay transfers might take a while to complete. Waiting on the transaction on the
        sending chain doesn't help here. For this reason we build a simple endpoint that let's you
        check the status of your transfer.

        Important: The endpoint returns a `200` successful response even if the transaction can not be
        found. This behavior accounts for the case that the transaction hash is valid but the
        transaction has not been mined yet.

        While non of the parameters `fromChain`, `toChain` and `bridge` are required, passing the
        `fromChain` parameter will speed up the request and is therefore encouraged.

        If you want to learn more about how to use this endpoint please have a look at our
        [guide](https://docs.li.fi/introduction/user-flows-and-examples/status-tracking).

      description: >-
        This endpoint can be used to request a quote for a transfer of one token to another, cross
        chain or not.

        The endpoint returns a `Step` object which contains information about the estimated result as
        well as a `transactionRequest` which can directly be sent to your wallet.

        The estimated result can be found inside the `estimate`, containing the estimated `toAmount`
        of the requested `Token` and the `toAmountMin`, which is the guaranteed minimum value that the
        transfer will yield including slippage.
